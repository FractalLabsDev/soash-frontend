# ðŸ§  Soash - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Soash is an AI-powered social media intelligence platform that enables content creators and business owners to understand what content performs well, receive data-driven recommendations, and improve their social media ROI through automated insights and strategic guidance.

The platform acts as a "brain hub" that integrates with existing social media accounts to analyze historical performance, identify patterns, and provide actionable recommendations without replacing the creative tools users already love.
